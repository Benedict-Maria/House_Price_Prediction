This project presents a complete end-to-end Machine Learning model designed to predict house prices based on key structural and locality features. Built using a custom dataset containing both numerical attributes (such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and parking) and categorical attributes (including mainroad availability, guestroom presence, basement facility, hot water heating, air-conditioning, preferred area, and furnishing status), this system provides a reliable and practical solution for real-estate price estimation.

The dataset undergoes a series of essential preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding, and standardizing numerical features through feature scaling. After data cleaning and preparation, the project applies multiple regression techniques to evaluate performance, with Random Forest Regression emerging as the best-performing model for this dataset. The final model is trained and validated using an 80-20 split and evaluated with metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² Score, ensuring both interpretability and accuracy.

This project also includes a Streamlit-based web application, allowing users to input house features and instantly receive a predicted price. The app provides a clean, interactive interface, making the model accessible even to non-technical users. To facilitate easy deployment, the project supports running the Streamlit app directly in Google Colab using Cloudflared, enabling seamless public access without requiring additional hosting services.
