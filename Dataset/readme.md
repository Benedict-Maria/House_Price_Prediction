The dataset used in this project contains various features that influence house prices. It includes a mix of numerical and categorical attributes describing the physical structure of the house, available facilities, and location-related preferences. These features help the model learn patterns that determine property value.

Numerical Features

price – The target variable representing the selling price of the house.

area – Total built-up area of the house (in sq. ft).

bedrooms – Number of bedrooms.

bathrooms – Number of bathrooms.

stories – Total number of stories.

parking – Number of parking spaces available.

Categorical Features

furnishingstatus – Furnishing level of the house (furnished/semi-furnished/unfurnished).

Purpose of the Dataset

The dataset provides a realistic combination of structural and locational factors that influence housing prices. It is suitable for:

Regression modeling

Feature importance analysis

Experimenting with categorical encoding

Building ML-powered real-estate recommendation systems
